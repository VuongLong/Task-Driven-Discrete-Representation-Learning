## Gridworld Experiments

### Installing
For our implementation:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This code is based on [this repo](https://github.com/camall3n/markov-state-abstractions), so some other module must be installed separately, such as `visgrid`, follow the instruction in the repo to install these modules.

### Running
```
python -m train_rep [args]
python -m train_agent [args]
python -m plot_empty10.py [args]
```


### Reproducing results in the paper
run the bash scripts in `sh` folder
